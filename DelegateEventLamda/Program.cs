     * Delegates: Placeholders for functions
     * Delegates can be dynamically chained together
     *      - Like C++function pointers or JS callbacks
     *      - Type safe : C# compiler checks signatures
     *      - Can be used to define callback functions
     *      - Can be dynamically switched at run time
     * Delegate composable
     * 
     * Events: Used to broadcast and listen to messages
     *      - Based on delegates
     *      - Enable asynchronous communication
     *      - Switch on and off as needed
     *      - Can create custom events
     *      
     * 
     * Lambdas: Functionally the same as regular delegates
